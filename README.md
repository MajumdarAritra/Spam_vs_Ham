# Spam_vs_Ham<br>
# Overview<br>
The Spam vs. Ham classification project is designed to classify messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (not spam) using machine learning algorithms. This project demonstrates the application of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to identify spam messages effectively.<br>

# Features<br>
Classify messages as Spam or Ham using machine learning.<br>
Text preprocessing including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.<br>
Feature extraction using techniques like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF.<br>
Model training and evaluation with various classification algorithms.<br>
